### Hello Worlds!

I'm [Josh Karpel](https://www.jtk.dev/)!

I'm currently a Software Engineer in Machine Learning at [Workday](https://github.com/Workday).

Before that, I was a postdoc at the
[Morgridge Institute for Research](https://morgridge.org/) 
/
[Center for High-Throughput Computing](http://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/).
I facilitated high-throughput computing projects, particularly ones that involve machine learning, image processing, and/or Python.
I also helped maintain the 
[HTCondor Python Bindings](https://htcondor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/apis/python-bindings/index.html) 
and worked on projects like 
[HTMap](https://htmap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
