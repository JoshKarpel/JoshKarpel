### Hello World!

I'm [Josh Karpel](https://www.jtk.dev/).
I work at the
[Morgridge Institute for Research](https://morgridge.org/) 
and the
[Center for High-Throughput Computing](http://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/)
on facilitating high-throughput computing projects, particularly ones that involve machine learning, image processing, and/or Python.
I also help maintain the 
[HTCondor Python Bindings](https://htcondor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/apis/python-bindings/index.html) 
and work on other Python-related HTCondor Software Suite projects like 
[HTMap](https://htmap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
