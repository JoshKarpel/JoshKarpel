I'm currently a Software Engineer in Machine Learning at [Workday](https://github.com/Workday).
I design and develop systems for connecting ML predictions to the outside world.

Before that, I was a postdoc at the
[Morgridge Institute for Research](https://morgridge.org/) 
/
[Center for High-Throughput Computing](http://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/).
I facilitated high-throughput computing projects that involved machine learning, image processing, and Python.
I also helped maintain the 
[HTCondor Python Bindings](https://htcondor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/apis/python-bindings/index.html) 
and worked on projects like 
[HTMap](https://htmap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
Before that, 
I got a PhD in Physics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the Yavuz Group,
working on simulating interactions between quantum systems and high-power lasers.
